            <p>Rochester community members have a long history of resisting injustices and inequities. Individual activists, mutual aid groups, and large community organizations have fought national and local policies that overwhelmingly affect people of color. On this map, we are working to document sites of resistance, many of which are included in the antiracist curriculum materials available on our site. These stories are part of Monroe Countyâ€™s past and present - and these stories will continue to be part of its future.</p>
