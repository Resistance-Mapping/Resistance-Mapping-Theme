<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Resistance Mapping is a local, collaborative digital humanities project focused on how the places of Monroe County, NY have been shaped by histories of institutional racism and collective community resistance.

Our aim is to create a living archive that:

 1. documents the history of racist housing and other place-based policies in Rochester and the surrounding region
 2. explores how our city’s current segregation emerges from that history
 3. confronts these realities through stories of past and present activism, along with creative imagined possibilities for our community’s future

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Currently this project is only augmenting the existing Omeka S theme through the use of CSS injection. All custom CSS developed for resistance mapping is contained in the file `main.css`

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

In order to utilize this theme, one must simply copy/paste the css contained in `main.css` into the CSS injection page on the admin panel of their Omeka S instance
